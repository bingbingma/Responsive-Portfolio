        Hi, I'm David Ma, an aspiring coder. Welcome to my Portfolio! <br />
        <br />
        I was born in Beijing, China. My last name Ma (simplified Chinese:
        <strong>马</strong>; traditional Chinese: <strong>馬</strong>; pinyin:
        Mǎ) means horse in English, which is why the favicon of this portfolio
        site is a horse. <br />
        <br />
        At the age of 6, I moved to the US to Cleveland, Ohio, which is where I
        grew up. I am 2 years younger than Lebron James who is also from the
        Cleveland area, and was a big fan of Lebron until he left for the Miami
        Heat during the "Decision", but begrudgingly welcomed him back to
        Cleveland and was ultimately happy that the Cavs won their first
        championship. <br />
        <br />
        I moved to NYC when I was 18 for college, where I got my Bachelors of
        Science in Operations Research with a Minor in Economics at Columbia
        University. Since graduating I've worked in various positions across
        finance at the New York Stock Exchange, in technology at a startup
        Openfolio, and most recentely in insurance at Marsh. I have a confession
        - I flunked my very first Intro to Computer Science class at Columbia,
        and my effort with this Bootcamp is to rectify that. I am planning on
        using my newly learned skills to create a website for my upcoming
        Children's Book, The Emperor's Seed. More Importantly, I am hoping this
        class will serve as a foundation for learning coding in general
        including new languages, thought processes, and skills that can be
        useful for a lifetime. <br />
        <br />
        Thank you for visiting. This is the first working webpage that I wrote
        from scratch. I hope you enjoyed your visit!
